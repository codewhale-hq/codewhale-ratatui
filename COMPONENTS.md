# Component source crosswalk

This library extracts the current Codewhale TUI into reusable Ratatui parts.
The native components preserve its layout and palettes. Optional compositions
retain useful desktop-inspired alternatives. See [VIEWS.md](VIEWS.md) for the
terminal view inventory and runnable recipes.

Source snapshots inspected for this crosswalk:

- **Design authority:** `codewhale-design` at
  `642795c1f9ef465b8d4f4df8584d23be28af6e9f`, `DIRECTION.md` and
  `tokens.json` version **1.1.2**. This kit vendors its token release in
  [vendor/codewhale-design](vendor/codewhale-design).
- **Kit baseline:** `d02d14799b046fb6c9fdd3969c36ec9202251f34`, with the
  native component extraction represented below.

The current terminal source is the native baseline. Desktop references inform
optional cards and workspace compositions; the shared whale performance core
retains the native character. The library supplies reusable presentation and
input helpers, while each consuming app supplies its own data and actions.
The inspected terminal files are recorded in [assets/tui-source.json](assets/tui-source.json).

## From product source to kit parts

“Primitive” means a small visual or input building block. “Composite” means
a reusable arrangement of those parts over facts supplied by the host.
Gallery names are the exact names accepted by the gallery example; the
[gallery sources](src/gallery) contain the fixture calls and all variants.

The integrated `showcase-work`, `showcase-decision`, `showcase-color`,
`showcase-life` and `showcase-narrow` scenes arrange existing components with
illustrative facts. They are examples of composition, not additional
production session models.

## Pending input and authored transcript

These additive APIs close two concrete visual gaps found in the source
comparison. They represent the implementation slice's public contracts;
they do not claim the Engine or GPUI queue/parser has been migrated.

`PendingInputPreview::new(items, context)` accepts stable caller IDs,
reported pending states, attached context and optional selected ID. Its
`actions()`/`actions_for()` are metadata: the host sends, edits or drops an
item and reports the resulting state. An empty preview takes zero rows.
`Unconfirmed` context must not become an assertion that a file was included
or sent. Approval policy and attention prioritization remain with the host;
compose this preview beside `AttentionQueue` and `Composer` as appropriate.

`PendingCard` accepts the native composer's sending, editing and queued input,
independent context inclusion/removability/selection facts, priority notices,
localized `PendingCardWords` and optional five-slot `PendingCardStyles`. It
shares one measured row plan with `PendingInputPreview`, including clipping
and the one-row controls fallback. The host still owns every queue mutation,
child request and keyboard action.

`Transcript::new(blocks)` accepts already-authored blocks and semantic
spans. Headings, prose, quotes, lists, tables and `CodeBlock` do not require
another Markdown parser. `CodeBlock::copy_text()` supplies the original
source; the host decides whether to put it on the clipboard. `links()`
returns targets out of band; the host validates and dispatches them.
The text displayed on the terminal is sanitized independently of the source
bytes used for copy or link actions.

## Host responsibilities

- **Engine and store:** the host owns sessions, turns, provider routing,
  tools, permissions, queue mutation, persistence and event ordering. A
  painted state or receipt is exactly what the caller supplied.
- **Input and actions:** kit state helpers report outcomes. They never
  launch tools, submit prompts, allow commands or discard files. Approval
  hosts retain the arm-after-paint guard and handle incomplete subjects.
- **Parser and highlighter:** the host owns Markdown parsing and syntax
  highlighting. The kit paints structured transcript blocks and supplied
  diff lines. `parse_unified` is a display convenience, not a diff engine.
- **Clipboard and links:** copy text and link targets are metadata. The host
  owns clipboard access, URL validation and opening the destination; no
  terminal escape sequence or inline media loader is introduced.
- **Clock and redraws:** elapsed `Duration` and sampled `Instant` come from
  the host. The host owns one event loop and redraw schedule. Spinners,
  transitions, habitat and Ocean do not acquire their own clocks.
- **Character performance:** keep one host-owned `whale_motion::Stage` or
  `Director` per identity. Feed authoritative observed inputs into that core,
  then paint its frame; widgets do not infer agent activity or instantiate
  independent Directors.
- **Colors:** `Theme` and the vendored roles remain the authority for state
  ink, actions and semantic surfaces. Native Ocean's exact dark stops apply
  to ordinary grounds under known dark truecolor Underwater; other native
  presets, lower depths and terminal-owned shells retain their own grounds. `Ombre` offers opt-in spatial washes, not new state
  hues. Character and syntax colors are content.

## Shared native Dock tabs and packed character raster

`Workbar` uses `DockTabRow` for its fitted tab paint and hitboxes. The Engine
adapter supplies available panels, counts, active/pressed/hovered targets, live
styles and the actual close label. `DockTabPlan` sheds counts before inactive
right-hand tabs and exposes only painted action boxes. Engine continues to own
keyboard focus, detail precedence, Esc meaning and every action. This shares the
tab row; it does not claim that Engine's full Dock body uses `Workbar`.

`BrailleFrame` paints the existing host's row-major packed cells and raw caption
with the supplied ink and modifiers, including the Engine's 18×5 cameo raster
and embedded world's current raster through their shared `render_grid` facade.
Zero cells remain transparent; a tiny viewport retains the wrapped caption.
`Whale::paint_frame` uses the same packed-cell painter while retaining its
semantic state words, whole-frame admission and theme gradient. Neither path
adds a clock, simulation, color classification or a new character authority.

The existing `ocean-native-guarded` gallery directly uses `OceanPaintFacts`,
`OceanCausticFacts` and `ocean_semantic_surfaces`. `OceanContrastInks` supplies
the host role mapping for guarded native finishing. These are
presentation facts and protection helpers; they do not grant terminal capability
or weaken motion, selection, REVERSED or contrast guards.

`WorkbarLayout::for_body` shares header folding, overflow reservation, content
geometry and offset fitting with Engine's body viewport. `WorkbarScrollbar`
shares its rail math and paint. Native row composition, detail/focus gutters
and caller action/tooltip projection remain Engine-owned; this does not yet
claim full row-composer replacement by `Workbar`.

## Pixel sprites

`GridSprite` paints Codewhale's hand-written pixel characters with half
blocks: one column per cell, two cells per row. It is separate from the painted
avatar packs and from `Whale`; it replaces neither.

Source: `assets/sprites/whale.grid` (v3) and `assets/sprites/whale-girl.grid`
(v2) are byte copies of the design source,
`pixel-system/sprites/` in the 2026-10-07 design study. `tests/grid_sprite.rs`
pins each file's SHA-256, so a local edit or a stale copy fails. To take a new
drawing, copy the file again and update its hash. The grammar is recorded at
the top of `whale.grid`.

| Body | Size | Poses |
|---|---|---|
| Whale `mark` | 16 columns by 7 rows | `rest` |
| Whale `favicon` | 16 by 8 | `rest` |
| Whale `companion` | 26 by 11 | `rest`, `think`, `read`, `write`, `run`, `needs-you`, `done`, `sleep` |
| Whale `hero` | 42 by 19 | `rest`, `done`, `sleep` |
| Whale girl `small` | 16 by 11 | the same eight |
| Whale girl `hero` | 39 by 26 | the same eight |

```rust
use codewhale_ratatui::{GridSprite, Paint};
if let Some(whale) = GridSprite::whale("companion", "done") {
    whale.paint(area, buf, &theme);
}
```

`GridSheet::parse` reads any grid in the grammar into `GridPose`s: a stage of
cells, each empty or a `GridInk` (a `GridToken` and its `fill`/`open` level).
It rejects what the design's reference parser rejects, and also a name
defined twice and a canvas over 256 cells a side. `GridSheet::whale()` and
`GridSheet::whale_girl()` parse the shipped files once.

- **Still.** Nothing animates and the widget holds no clock. A layer written
  as frames (`bubbles.0`, `bubbles.1`, `bubbles.2`) paints its last frame,
  which the grammar defines as the still.
- **Whole or absent.** Pixel art is never resampled or cropped. A pose is
  centred in its area, and is not painted when the area is smaller than
  `columns()` by `rows()`; `fits(area)` lets the host give that room to text.
  A placement that crosses the buffer's edge is clipped safely.
- **Decoration.** A sprite writes no words. Put the heading or status text
  beside it; that text carries the meaning, and a sprite is never the only
  carrier of a state. A host with a plain or screen-reader mode leaves the
  sprite out. `examples/grid_sprite.rs` labels every pose with its name.
- **Colors come from the theme.** No sprite color is stored. Each token
  resolves at paint time, so the native palettes and both grounds work
  without a second table:

| Token | Resolves to | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `whale` | `Primary` | Blue means the whale is present. |
| `text`, `panel`, `warn` | `Foreground`, `Surface`, `Attention` | Exact roles. |
| `cream`, `line` | the theme's lightest and darkest of body ink and grounds | Measured by luminance, so a light and a dark theme both keep a pale belly and a dark eye. |
| `whale-lite`, `whale-deep`, `whale-pleat` | `Primary` mixed 35% to lightest, 40% to darkest; lightest mixed 30% to `Primary` | No role matches; a fixed mix of two roles. |
| `girl-hair`, `girl-cloth`, `girl-pale` | `Primary` mixed 55% to darkest; darkest mixed 30% to `Primary`; lightest mixed 40% to `Primary` | As above. |
| `girl-skin`, `girl-blush`, `girl-gold` | lightest mixed 14% and 45% to `Danger`; `Attention` mixed 20% to lightest | As above. These three are the least faithful to the study's proposed values. |

- **Fallbacks.** Truecolor on a measured ground paints exact RGB; 256 colors
  use the role tables and the xterm cube for the mixes. `NO_COLOR`, 16 colors
  and an unmeasured ground paint the grid's documented one-ink map in
  `Primary`: `fill` inks print, `open` inks (cream, skin, paper, the whale's
  eye) and empty cells do not. ASCII-safe output uses `"`, `_` and `#` for
  the upper half, lower half and full cell. A role a native palette leaves to
  the terminal is not painted.

Run `cargo run --example grid_sprite` for every pose on every theme, or add
`--text` for plain glyphs. The sprites have no gallery entry yet, so the
generated README boards do not show them. No host has adopted them: the
Engine's pet and avatar surfaces are unchanged.
