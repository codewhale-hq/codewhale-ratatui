//! Motion: the few things that move, and the promise that nothing else does.
//!
//! Motion is allowed for a change of state or for spatial continuity, and
//! nothing else: no sweeps, dissolves, glitches or bounces. This module is
//! that layer in a few hundred lines, instead of a dependency.
//!
//! - A [`MotionStep`] eases a value from where it is to a target in `0..=1`,
//!   sampled at an instant the caller passes in. Nothing here reads a clock,
//!   spawns a thread or waits.
//! - [`MotionPolicy`] says what may move. `Full` animates; `Reduced` and
//!   `Still` jump straight to the end state, and every helper takes the
//!   policy so a component cannot forget it. Color steps run at truecolor
//!   only: at 256 and 16 colors the in-between values snap into visible
//!   flicker, so the step is skipped (§4.3).
//! - [`MotionSet::next_frame_at`] is the whole scheduler: the next instant a
//!   redraw is due, never sooner than the frame cap, and `None` once
//!   everything has settled, so an idle screen asks for zero redraws.
//!
//! The host owns the loop. After each draw it calls `next_frame_at(now,
//! policy)` and sleeps until that instant, or until an event, whichever comes
//! first. `None` means sleep until an event.
