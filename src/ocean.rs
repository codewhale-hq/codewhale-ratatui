//! Codewhale's terminal-native underwater column, as a finishing pass.
//!
//! Adapted from `Hmbown/CodeWhale`'s `crates/tui/src/tui/ocean.rs` at
//! `a79ce5c4d5ed1a5f7032185710c27343a900351c`: the authored three stops,
//! quadratic depth curve, context rise, 90-second phase breath, steady
//! attention/failure tint and 800-millisecond completion breath. The host
//! supplies time and phase; this module owns no clock, event loop or theme.
//!
//! Paint ordinary components first, then apply the column to their ordinary
//! `Background` and `Sidebar` cells. Raised surfaces, selections, diff/code
//! grounds, custom fills, symbols, inks and modifiers remain theirs. The
//! authored dark field is available only on known dark truecolor Ocean
//! grounds. Graphite, light, unknown grounds and lower depths keep the theme.
//! Native chrome can join the same column with [`OceanColumn::apply_matching`]
//! over its own region and explicit base ground. Native cached-row painting,
//! semantic-surface projection and sparse caustics are adapted from the same
//! MIT-licensed Engine at `e7de150f3621740c982e7e6c90d69ac48ccc80d5`;
//! capability facts, palette adaptation, cache and redraw lifecycle stay host-owned.
