//! The whale, drawn in Braille dots.
//!
//! The C-shaped whale from the Codewhale mark, as the v2 pet
//! (`whale-character-v2`), is the one character on every surface. The desktop
//! app draws it with the v2 rig; the terminal draws the same contours as
//! Braille dots. Its states carry meaning: the kit's 17 actions, from resting
//! and listening through reading, editing and running to needs you and done,
//! and a pod, where calves swim with it while agents work in parallel. The
//! art has room for three calves; the words always carry the real count, and
//! a pod of none is drawn as plain work, never with an invented calf.
//!
//! `assets/whale-v2.scenes` holds the poster pose of each state as exact
//! cubic contours, exported from the v2 kit's Director by
//! `tools/export-whale.cjs`. [`rasterize`] is a port of the kit's pure
//! vector-to-dot renderer (`braille.js`): flatten each cubic into ten
//! segments, fill scanlines by even-odd crossings at dot centres (so the
//! throat and eye holes stay open), and pack each 2x4 block into one
//! `U+2800` cell. It reproduces the kit's 32x16 and 20x10 stills exactly
//! (`tests/whale.rs`).
//!
//! The art is decoration; the state lives in the words beside it. Screen
//! readers get the label, never a stream of dot names, and ASCII-safe
//! terminals get the words alone.
//!
//! [`Whale::paint_frame`] accepts a packed frame from the host's shared
//! Director. This renderer owns no clock, animation or state selection;
//! [`Paint::paint`] keeps drawing the existing poster pose.
