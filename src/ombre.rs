//! An opt-in atmosphere: one spatial ombre painted over a finished scene.
//!
//! A host paints its components through [`Theme`] as usual and then calls
//! [`Ombre::apply`] once, last, over the whole scene. That order is the whole
//! contract: every ground a component paints is already on the buffer, so
//! the pass repaints the cells whose background is one of the five structural
//! grounds (Sidebar, Background, Surface, Hover, Selected) and leaves glyphs,
//! every foreground, content and diff tints, action fills and any color the
//! tokens do not name exactly as they were painted.
//!
//! The wash is spatial, not a flat theme swatch: each cell is tinted toward
//! the blend of two token hues at its own position along the requested
//! [`Rect`], anchored to that rect even when only its visible intersection is
//! painted. The luminance the source ground was audited with is restored
//! afterwards ([`crate::color::tint_keeping_luminance`]), so every contrast
//! the tokens passed still holds. A nonblank cell is repainted only when the
//! result keeps its ink at `min(original contrast, the ink's audited floor)`;
//! blank cells carry the gradient without that proof, so the wash stays
//! continuous where nothing is written on it.
//!
//! | Palette | Runs between | Reads as |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`WaterPalette::Ocean`] | the logo ombre `#1E8FD8` → `#0B48BB` | deep water |
//! | [`WaterPalette::Lagoon`] | `Live` → `Primary` | the shallows |
//! | [`WaterPalette::Dusk`] | `Primary` → `Attention` | blue hour into a warm horizon |
//! | [`WaterPalette::Coral`] | `Danger` → `Attention` | a reef |
//! | [`WaterPalette::Graphite`] | the exact token grounds, no tint | graphite |
//!
//! In a light appearance the hues for Lagoon, Dusk and Coral are read from
//! the light token table, so paper gets pale washes of its own tokens; Ocean
//! keeps the logo pair, as a pale wash. Where a ground cannot hold a hue and
//! keep the luminance it was audited with (paper's pure white surface), it is
//! left exactly as the theme painted it.
//!
//! The pass runs at truecolor on a measured appearance only. At 256 colors,
//! 16 colors, `NO_COLOR`, ASCII-safe output and an unmeasured ground the
//! audited [`Theme`] is painted exactly as everywhere else.
//!
//! [`WaterPalette::Graphite`] does not tint: on a dark truecolor terminal it
//! remaps the five structural grounds to the graphite token grounds (the ones
//! the desktop app paints), so an Ocean-themed host can show real graphite.
//! On a light terminal it is pass-through, because paper already is the light
//! token table. A theme already at [`crate::Ground::Graphite`] is left alone.
//!
//! The palette is atmosphere, never state: no state word or mark is given a
//! new hue, and nothing here runs on a clock or animates by itself.
