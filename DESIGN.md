# Codewhale terminal components

The current Codewhale TUI is the source for native components, layout,
backgrounds and ombré. Extract the existing presentation into public Ratatui
APIs; keep application data, actions and persistence in the host. Optional
compositions can explore useful alternatives without changing the native
baseline. [VIEWS.md](VIEWS.md) inventories the terminal screens.

## The water

`OceanColumn` adapts the existing Underwater treatment from
`CodeWhale/crates/tui/src/tui/ocean.rs` at
`a79ce5c4d5ed1a5f7032185710c27343a900351c`:

| Position | Ground |
|---|---|
| Surface | `#102A45` |
| Middle | `#0A1E33` |
| Deep | `#061320` |

One absolute vertical column connects the workspace, transcript and composer.
It does not restart inside each widget. Caller-reported waiting and approval
add the native warm cast; failure stays steady; completion breathes and settles.
Selections, elevated panels, diffs and code retain their own backgrounds.
The caller supplies phase, context percentage, motion policy and elapsed time.
Use `OceanColumn::viewport` for the shell bounds and `apply_matching` for each
native chrome band's base ground. Keep elevated and semantic surfaces outside
those bands; the finishing pass preserves their fills.
The field only paints measured dark truecolor Ocean; other profiles retain
their selected native or token grounds. The native light palettes keep their own grounds.

`Ombre` offers additional artistic treatments over completed component buffers:
Ocean uses the logo's blue pair, Lagoon uses Live into Primary, Dusk uses Primary
into Attention, Coral uses Danger into Attention, and Graphite maps the actual
desktop graphite grounds. These are spatial materials, never alternative state
colors. Paper uses pale washes. The finishing pass preserves glyphs, foregrounds,
content fills and caller colors, and keeps a text cell's original background
whenever a replacement cannot preserve its contrast floor. All fallback
profiles pass through unchanged.

## Work has priority

The default native layout has no permanent top header or right sidebar.
Conversation, pending input, the rounded composer, posture, workflow progress,
metrics and workbar form one vertical layout. The workbar has Tasks, Fleet,
Jobs, Files, Notes, Context, Git and Cost, with optional top and side placement.
Its row facts and keyboard outcomes belong to the caller.

Native palette slots retain their separate Working, Success, Warning,
permission and mode colors. Marks and words preserve meaning under no color
or ASCII. Narrow surfaces shed secondary information before essential input,
permission and model/context information.

`WorkspaceFrame`, `ContextRibbon`, author-heading messages, desktop-style
cards and the extra `Ombre` palettes are optional compositions. They are not
substitutes for the TUI baseline.

## Life and motion

The C-shaped Codewhale is the same character as the native client. The
`whale_motion` core adapts its existing pure Rust springs, authored clips,
props, particles, scene and cove, rather than adding another performance model.
Provenance and selected conformance fixtures live in
[assets/whale-motion](assets/whale-motion/PROVENANCE.md).

One session-scoped `Stage` receives explicit owner inputs and advances on the
host's clock. Changing session resets the performance. Hiding a surface stops
painting; resuming discards missed motion. Braille cadence is capped at six
paints per second in action and two at rest. The full-color `WhalePet` uses
the GPUI hero cadence: 30 paints per second in action, eight at rest. These
are scheduling ceilings; the host owns the redraw policy. Reduced motion
uses the authored poster and schedules no redraw. Every pet keeps readable
state words.

`WhalePet` paints the GPUI cove and its full contour rig into a bounded,
antialiased RGBA image, then reuses the avatar half-block painter. This keeps
the two-stop body gradient, light eye/throat apertures, prop colors and partial
opacity of entering/exiting shapes. Scenery is painted behind the whale and
near water in front, in the native client's order. The same Stage supplies
resting pointer attention and decorative water ripples. Monochrome, ANSI-16
and unknown grounds retain Braille; ASCII and tiny viewports retain words.
`examples/pet.rs` is the live action tour and reproducible buffer export.

Braille has one foreground per cell. The colored adapter samples native ink at
visible dots, chooses the majority shape, and resolves ties by paint order.
The monochrome packed geometry remains an independent conformance oracle.
The studio paints the character after the water, using the optional
`paint_with_contrast` floor of 3:1 for decorative ink. It mixes only insufficient
inks toward the theme foreground; ordinary `paint` retains native ink exactly.
Fish, rare jellyfish and bubbles occupy open water around text; their bounded
populations and caller-clock motion settle under reduced or still policies.

## Host boundaries and verification

Components own paint and local presentation geometry. The host owns Engine
events, permission decisions, queue mutation, Markdown parsing, clipboard,
link navigation, persistence and the event loop. `Transcript` accepts typed
authored blocks; `CodeBlock` keeps original source separate from safe display.

The live showcase and captured previews use the same renderer. Every catalog
entry is exported in nine terminal profiles and included in the generated
README's dark and light boards. Tests cover clipping, Unicode, safe display,
color fallbacks, motion lifecycle and canonical native geometry. Hosted CI
checks source, snapshots and media hashes. These checks establish library
behavior. Engine adoption is separate work.
